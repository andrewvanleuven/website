abstract: "Seen as a potential remedy for decades of disinvestment and physical deterioration in historic town centers, the Main Street Program is a smaller-scale economic development approach that has been adopted by hundreds of communities throughout the rural United States. In this paper, I use longitudinal business establishment data to evaluate the viability of the Main Street Program as a means of rural downtown revitalization. I implement a difference-in-differences design which estimates the program's causal impact on job growth in the downtown retail district."
