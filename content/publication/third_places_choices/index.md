abstract: "While much of our adult lives unfold either at home or in the workplace, many of our most meaningful social interactions occur somewhere else entirely. These “third places” are where we form and deepen friendships, worship and commune together, and otherwise engage in civic and community social life. Cafes, bars, and restaurants often serve as cultural touchstones, shaping our shared narratives both in real life and in popular culture, from Moe’s Tavern in The Simpsons to the breakfast diner in Seinfeld."
