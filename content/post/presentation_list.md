I present to a wide variety of groups, so even if I present the same thing twice, I will always tweak the presentation slightly, tailoring it to the audience. That said, this list doesn't include *every* version of every presentation I've given. If you're looking for a particular talk that I gave that is *not* on this list, please [email me](mailto:andrew.vanleuven@okstate.edu).
