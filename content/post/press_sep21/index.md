I was recently interviewed by Clark Merrefield (reporter for Harvard Kennedy School's *Journalist's Resource*) about my economic revitalization research paper [pubished in EDQ](https://doi.org/10.1177/08912424211038060).

Click [**here**](https://journalistsresource.org/politics-and-government/main-street-revitalization-jobs/) to read the article.

According to their website, *The Journalist’s Resource* "curates, summarizes and contextualizes high-quality research on newsy public policy topics." Their write-up of my research paper is a great resource for policymakers and community leaders—as well as local news outlets—to read, as it is written in a very clear and concise style.

In addition to his excellent write-up, I am grateful to Clark for seeing my research and initiating the interview. Here is his Twitter coverage of the article:
