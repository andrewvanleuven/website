### Abstract

Downtown revitalization has become a prevalent approach for communities attempting to combat the effects of both economic decline and the decades-long planning emphasis on automobile-oriented retail development. One such endeavor, the Main Street Program (MSP), equips smaller towns and cities with the resources and know-how to leverage their dense, walkable retail corridor(s) as an economic development asset. My dissertation will assess the viability of the MSP as a means of scalable, sustainable regeneration of a community's central business district. First, I empirically estimate the program's economic impact---both in terms of employment and property value appreciation. I then examine how differing state and local regulative environments influence how community MSP directors prioritize how they measure program performance.

### Research Questions

* Does adopting the Main Street Program significantly affect job creation in participating communities? If so, how large is the impact, and in what type of communities is it strongest?
* Does the Main Street Program affect residential property values nearby and adjacent to Main Street-adjacent neighborhoods? If so, how large is the impact, and in what type of communities is it the strongest? What is the maximum distance (away from Main Street) at which an effect persists?
* Which indicators of performance do community Main Street Program directors use to define program success? Is there conflict between state- and community-level MSP organizations in how they define program success? To what extent is this moderated by the community MSP's publicness?
