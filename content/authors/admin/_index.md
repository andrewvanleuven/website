I am a postdoctoral fellow at the College of Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resources (CAFNR) at the University of Missouri. I work with Dr. Sarah Low at the Division of Social Sciences on research and Extension programming centered around regional economic & entrepreneurial development ([MU Exceed](https://extension.missouri.edu/programs/exceed-community-economic-and-entrepreneurial-development)). I am working on a variety of different projects in different topic areas, ranging from small-town economic revitalization to business dynamics and local entrepreneurship. I earned my Ph.D. in public policy & management from the John Glenn College of Public Affairs (Ohio State University).
