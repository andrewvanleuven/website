I am a Ph.D. candidate at The Ohio State Universityâ€™s John Glenn College of Public Affairs. I am currently working on a dissertation which uses the case of the Main Street Program to explore several questions surrounding local economic development policy. I currently work with Dr. Ned Hill on research related to regional economic resilience and have also worked with the Ohio Manufacturing Institute (OMI) as a data analyst. I earned a B.S. in geography with a planning concentration and an M.A. in urban studies.
