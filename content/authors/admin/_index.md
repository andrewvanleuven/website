I am an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University in the Department of Agricultural Economics. My [research](https://andrewvanleuven.com/#publications) and [Extension programming](https://extension.okstate.edu/programs/community-and-economic-development/index.html) both focus on regional economic development, downtown revitalization, local entrepreneurship, and a variety of other topics aimed toward strengthening rural economies. I earned my Ph.D. in Public Policy & Management from the John Glenn College of Public Affairs (Ohio State University).
